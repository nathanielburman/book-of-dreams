Hi Storm! :D

So last night i had about 3 dreams that i can almost remember right now. This is strange, i was on a football team. and we made it to some really big game. it was big! All these people and cheerleaders and the yelling, the lights. we made some really big plays. and i made a touchdown! for real! it was awesome! the dream i cant quite remember properly was the dream where i was inside a store or a mall or something like that, with many other people. and i really cant remember that one. but the last dream i had i do remember! i think it came from the book i was reading but... well listen to this. hehehahaha. First i was in this band. i was the drummer. i played on an electric set of drums but they werent like a normal set of drumms they were very different. someone was helping me set them up. there were four people in the band. the lead singer was this guy that had blond hair was really buff and looked kinda like a movie star. we were playing a show. the time was not in this era. we were playing like in the seventies or something. well. i think the buff guy and i were friends after the show we talked. there was someone else with us. well this is when it turned into something eles entirely. the buff guy was actually a chicken and his personallity changed too. he was shy and cowardly. but big and buff with the blond hair, but he was a chicken!!! then the other guy that was with me was actually a cat! Purple and his personality was cocky as hell! He was tall and slender. his legs slender yet muscular like a cats. We were outside......
to be continued.....

I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!

My brother had a nightmare that that evil old ugly Black Democrat racist who is a senator in America, 

was chasing him through the street with her goons. And they were big goons chasing after him.

She caught him and showed him a bloody syringe needle.

He thought he escaped from her in his dream.
